  Using infinite lists
  at first, with fibs and tail fibs, we can get the 3rd element:

  fibs                        : [1, 1, ?
  tail fibs                   : [1, ?
  zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs): [2, ?

fibs :: [Integer]
fibs = 1 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

fibs' :: Int -> [Integer]
fibs' n = take n (fibs)

fibsTakeWhile :: Integer -> [Integer]
fibsTakeWhile n = takeWhile (<n) fibs

  print ("Enter an upper limit for the fibonacci numbers")
  input <- getLine
  let n = read input :: Integer
  let f = fibsTakeWhile n
  let f_even = filter (\x -> mod x 2 == 0) f
  let f_even_sum = sum f_even
  print ("The sum of the fibonacci numbers up to " ++ show n ++ " is " ++ show f_even_sum)
